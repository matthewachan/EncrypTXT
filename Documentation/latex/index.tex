Encrypt your text files by choosing two numbers to seed a random number generator. Each character in your text file will be encrypted using those seeds you pick, meaning that your file can only be decrypted using the same seeds. In a sense, those two seeds are two numerical passwords which are used to access your files. My use case for this program is for encrypting a text file containing all of my passwords and sensitive data -- this way I can keep my passwords file in plain view without having to worry about others stealing my passwords
